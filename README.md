# Learning Web Development
Practice makes perfect! While learning web development I worked on a lot of fun projects. I learned really interesting concepts from every single one of them, Just by recreating different websites and challenging myself.

### -> Each branch on this repo contains a different layout.

**You can see some of them live here:** https://davidney.com/webservices
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

The layouts were built using HTML and CSS. In some of them, I used the CSS Layout - float and clear In others I used CSS Flexible Box Layout or a mix of both, this was to learn basic HTML and CSS concepts. While learning I attempted to make some of them elastic and responsive. 

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level is, start building and practicing because being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something even if it is very basic you will end up learning new things, new techniques, or best practices. I have improved a lot more since I built all these layouts but they were key in my learning experience and improvement. Now I can come back to this repo and see the before and after.
